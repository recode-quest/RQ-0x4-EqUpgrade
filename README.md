# 0x4 EQ Upgrade

> EQ upgrade is a system that allows upgrading player's equipment in games. Upgraded equipment becomes better, has better statistics (more damage, defense, health, etc.).
Players most often need some gold and materials to upgrade equipment and they have only a chance to upgrade successfully.
The result of upgrading process can be success, failure and even destruction or sometimes decrease upgrade level.

> If you have never met this system, you can try it online. [Nosapki](https://nosapki.nostale.club/ulepszanieeq) < This is example of simulation of upgrading equipment for Nostale MMORPG game.

Your task for this week will be to create program simulating **eq upgrade** (for real game or not) and count how many you need money and materials to upgrade :)
